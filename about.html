<p><strong>Ling Sheng Dian Dragon &amp; Lion Dance Centre — 靈聖殿龍獅學院（新加坡）</strong> was initiated in 2012 with an aim of keeping the essence of classic lion and dragon dance and in parallel instilling in the upcoming performers in Singapore. From a blazing passion, the group has matured into a sophisticated team recognized and appreciated for their precise discipline and sincere grace in performance.</p>

<p>The academy offers training on various aspects - body conditioning, basic foot works, formations, drumming, cymbals, and flag coordination. With the help of the coaches, the participants greatly appreciate the importance of mental and physical safety as well as the value of respect and technique. From the top of the stage or the street, we aim to give extraordinary authentic performances that are memorable.</p>

<p><strong>Regional Roots.</strong> Beyond Singapore, we are proud to share a common heritage with <em>Ling Sheng Dian Dragon &amp; Lion Dance Centre — 靈聖殿龍獅學院（马来西亚）</em>. This regional connection allows us to exchange knowledge, elevate standards, and celebrate the art form across borders, while remaining deeply rooted in the Singapore community.</p>

<p><strong>What We Do.</strong> We entertain for weddings, corporate events, community fairs, cultural celebrations, private event, business opening ceremonies, and of course the Lunar New Year Season. Each event is tailored to the venue and occasion - blessings to large stage shows - with safety, timing, and the needs of each client carefully considered.</p>

<p><strong>Our Promise.</strong> Every performance is an honour. We bring auspicious energy, thunderous drumbeats, and meticulous choreography to every appearance, aiming to uplift spirits and usher in good fortune for our clients and audiences.</p>
